No best way of managing schedule getting things done. so have a look at:

##2 Minute Rule
1. If it takes less than two minutes, then do it now.

2. When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.
every goal can be started in 2 minutes or less. Getting started is more imprortant than succeeding.


##Eisenhower Box
Seperate actions based on four possibilities
1. Urgent and important (do immediately)
2, Important, not urgent (schedule)
3. urgent, not important (delegate)
4. neither (eliminate)

> "What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important." - Dwight Eisenhower.

Delete any task that does not lead you towards your goal/mission/values
