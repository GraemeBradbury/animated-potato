#Guides for Writing

##Rules
* Edit everything - self-edit after done, keep only the best bits.
* Aim for a word count - gives concrete brevity goal
* Say what you really mean - after draft identify true meaning, rewrite to focus on meaning.
* Start boldly - remove all intro text, more powerful to get straight to the point.
* Organise relentlessly - Combine related points, cut redundancy.
* Prune sections/arguments - Delete extra arguments examples, 3 strong are better than 5 weak.
* Use bullets and tables - makes structure explicit
* Use graphics - pictures are easier to comprehend.
* Trim connective tissue - reduce linking and transition text, connecting words makes noisy prose.
* Delete weasel words and qualifiers - eg "very", "generally", qualifiers makes prose mushy.
