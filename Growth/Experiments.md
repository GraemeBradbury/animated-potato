#Learning Experiments

##Diet
* Ketogenic diet - was a very noticabley easier for me to get into flow, diet was absolute hell to maintain.

* Low Carb diet - was alot easier to stick but was also clear to me that it didn't give the same benefits as Keto. 

* Both diets improved mood and made it easier for me to just stick to the learning plans.

##Nootropics
* Tried various things, some of which had positive effects on friends. No noticeable effects on me.

##Sleep/Time
* Found that reduced sleep had a non-immediate knock on effect on learning. There was often 3-4 days before it had a negative effect and then was not really noticeable until review time.

* Experimented with learning at various times of the day. Found morning was much easier than afternoon. Did notice it was very difficult for me to learn after meetings/social time.

##Environment
* Working without headphones greatly increased irritability and lose of focus/flow.

* Upgraded to Active noise cancellation headphones. Found an improvement in dropping into flow compared with just music over regular headphones.

* Music variations - Tried various genres and found that taking up tempo non english language music combined really well with headphones to keep me in flow.

* Momentum -> Trello -> Pomello -
