Books, Books, and more Books.

They've been a defining part of me, today there is only one room left in my house that doesn't have a book shelf. Just this last fortnight I've read 3 novels a couple of short stories and a technical book.

When I was younger, I had a teacher mention that because kids are taught phonetically, First sounding the letter, then the word and finally sentence. That this results in most people going from reading aloud to reading "aloud" without making any noise. Just a voice in our head.

So I retaught myself to read. I now don't have that voice that I'm listening to, I "see" and "experience" the words on the page instead.

As a software developer being able to read and absorb ideas rapidly is a strength. My early career is basically me brute forcing data into my brain and then extracting it as needed. Nothing elegant or efficient but it worked. It was fun as well, I love learning new things, solving problems, generally encountering new ideas.

Then kids happened and over the course of the years they became more and more of my fun time.

So I wanted to get better at learning. It's the root of what we software engineers do, and if I get better I could spend less time on gaining knowledge just for me and my job, I could spend time with my family and learn the things that would allow me to enjoy their lives to answer and work through the questions that they had.

So that is what this talk is about.

I'm going to start with my answers to getting better at learning.

They're simply:
1. Consistency and Momentum
2. Engagement

These are just simple words, though not necessarily easy concepts to put into practice.

Basically I'm no different from you, so while these answers are mine and this story is about how I got to them, but we are all learners here so if you have questions as we go along please ask them, I will try and give details about my sources as we go along.
