 - Really good for your first time. Well done! With practice you will get better :)
 - Slides were perfect. Engaged audience. Passionate. Very well thought out and delivered. The start was a little slow could have done introduction to yourself sooner. Maybe. Thanks.
 - There were moments where the talk did not flow. Graeme got kind of stuck in retelling the same sentence in different ways. Excellent enthusiasm though. Enjoyed the talks/slides ratio. Good to only use slides as markers. Good work!
