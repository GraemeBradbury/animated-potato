#"Brain surgery for the autodidact." - How I relearned learning. #

##Summary##
It's the nature of a career in software development, that we are always learning.
In an attempt to create more time to spend on family and life, Graeme, in late 2014, asked himself "Am I learning effectively?"
This talk is a history of some of the techniques he tried, what worked (or not) and why.

##Perception##
1. Asperger diagnosis
2. Always been good at learning.
3. Enjoyed learning.
4. Time needed for other things.

"Can I do what I do, just ...better in every way?"
 
##Action##
1. Did the developer thing, and went to find a framework...
2. Found VARK... It works yay! it costs the same amount it saves booo! :-(
	- Finland schooling uses it.
	- increases retention by 1-3%
	- Can be hard to find resources
	- easy for me, but didn't really save time.
	- Did discover effects of journalling/==notes== on retention.
		- 1 month -> 3 month -> 9 month.
3. Found the learning "pyramid" 
	- Had an elegance, felt a little off.
	- Turned out to be a viral hoax...

A little disheartening:
"Can I do what I do, just ...faster"

this is painful at this point. All my guesses were way off 

##Will##

1. Charlie Munger about story of Buffet and the chauffer.
	- What was I doing to avoid thinking about the other things I want to learn.
	- Reminders of what I want to accomplish.
	- Without taking up too much time or effort... lazyness as a virtue...
	- using the mirror as a task list. whiteboard markers.

2. Planning the week before.
	- Ego depletion.

3. Habits using events and locations to trigger learning. Maintenance.

4. Getting it into your head.
	1. long term memory
	2. Challenge yourself 
	3. create models


##Finish##
While learning is a journey that never ends, this talk has to.

Thank you for listening to my first talk.
