#"Brain surgery for the autodidact - How I relearned to learn"#

##Summary##
In late 2014 I challenged my treasured assumption that I was good at learning. I wanted to spend more time with my kids, and all the out of hours study was cutting into this.

So I spent the next year (and more) investigating and trying out techniques to improve my ability to learn.

This is the story of how I learned I was actually rather poor at learning, what I did to improve, and how you can do the same.

##Perception##
1. Asperger diagnosis
2. Always been good at learning.
3. Enjoyed learning.
4. Time needed for other things.

"Can I do what I do, just ...better in every way?"
 
##Action##
1. Did the developer thing, and went to find a framework...
2. Found VARK... It works yay! it costs the same amount it saves booo! :-(
	- Finland schooling uses it.
	- increases retention by 1-3%
	- Can be hard to find resources
	- easy for me, but didn't really save time.
	- Did discover effects of journalling/==notes== on retention.
		- 1 month -> 3 month -> 9 month.
3. Found the learning "pyramid" 
	- Had an elegance, felt a little off.
	- Turned out to be a viral hoax...

A little disheartening:
"Can I do what I do, just ...faster"

this is painful at this point. All my guesses were way off 

##Will##

1. Charlie Munger about story of Buffet and the chauffer.
	- What was I doing to avoid thinking about the other things I want to learn.
	- Reminders of what I want to accomplish.
	- Without taking up too much time or effort... lazyness as a virtue...
	- using the mirror as a task list. whiteboard markers.

2. Planning the week before.
	- Ego depletion.

3. Habits using events and locations to trigger learning. Maintenance.

4. Getting it into your head.
	1. long term memory
	2. Challenge yourself 
	3. create models

5. SQ3R
	1. Skim through the upcoming material.
	2. Decide on questions?
	3. Read the material.
	4. Talk back yourself about the material.
	5. Go over what you missed.


##Finish##
While learning is a journey that never ends, this talk has to.

Thank you for listening to my first talk.

Books, Books, and more Books.

They've been a defining part of me, today there is only one room left in my house that doesn't have a book shelf. Just this last fortnight I've read 3 novels a couple of short stories and a technical book.

When I was younger, I had a teacher mention that because kids are taught phonetically, First sounding the letter, then the word and finally sentence. That this results in most people going from reading aloud to reading "aloud" without making any noise. Just a voice in our head.

So I retaught myself to read. I now don't have that voice that I'm listening to, I "see" and "experience" the words on the page instead.

As a software developer being able to read and absorb ideas rapidly is a strength. My early career is basically me brute forcing data into my brain and then extracting it as needed. Nothing elegant or efficient but it worked. It was fun as well, I love learning new things, solving problems, generally encountering new ideas.

Then kids happened and over the course of the years they became more and more of my fun time.

So I wanted to get better at learning. It's the root of what we software engineers do, and if I get better I could spend less time on gaining knowledge just for me and my job, I could spend time with my family and learn the things that would allow me to enjoy their lives to answer and work through the questions that they had.

So that is what this talk is about.

I'm going to start with my answers to getting better at learning.

They're simply:
1. Consistency and Momentum
2. Engagement

These are just simple words, though not necessarily easy concepts to put into practice.

So who Am I.

I'm Graeme, I've been a software developer for around 16 years now. I currently work as a contractor primarily in the world of .Net
Basically I'm no different from you, so while these answers are mine and this story is about how I got to them, but we are all learners here so if you have questions as we go along please ask them, I will try and give details about my sources as we go along.
